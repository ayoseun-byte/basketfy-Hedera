## üåç Overview

Basketfy makes crypto investing simple, social, and inclusive.

It enables anyone to **buy a theme instead of a token** ‚Äî investing in curated, on-chain portfolios that represent entire narratives like **AI**, **DeFi Blue Chips**, **Stable Income**, or **African Growth**.  
Each theme is represented by a **basket token (bToken)** and backed by real crypto assets, transparently managed through smart contracts on **Hedera**.

In emerging markets where **currency volatility is high**, stablecoins have become lifelines ‚Äî over **$50 billion in stablecoin transactions** were recorded in Africa over the past three years. Basketfy builds on this momentum by letting users **invest those stablecoins into diversified baskets**, lowering entry barriers and protecting purchasing power.
